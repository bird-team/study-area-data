# Study area data

This repository contains raw data and code used to produce data representing the spatial extent for the Atlas of the Birds of Brisbane (https://brisbanebirds.com).

## Usage

To create the data, clone this repository and execute the command `make all`. The spatial data will be output into the _exports_ directory. Once the data has been created, it can be copied into the _data_ directory in the atlas repository (https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas).
